My first step was running ArraySet.java to see which items were the first to fail.
The first failed test was in the new empty set methods.
I fixed this by setting rear as 0.
The next problems seem to be with the remove method.
I set breakpoints at line 179 in the SetTester.java but had a hard time seeing exactly what the issue was.
From the errors appearing in my ArraySet I saw that the program was giving a null pointer exception.
My fix was to include upper bounds for i +1.
After this I moved on to the add method.  The errors came back with a no such elements exception.
To fix this I added ++ to the rear variable after the given if statements, so that multiple elements could be added on.
These were all the changes I made. 
I had difficulty figuring out how to best use the debugger and most of my insights came from reading which tests failed and thinking about why they were failing.
I failed four tests but was never able to figure out why.
